A device can be an MCU-based hardware (e.g. NodeMCU, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc), a finished physical product like a Smart Air Conditioner, or a virtual service that sends data to Blynk.Cloud using REST API.

Blynk can connect your device to the Internet using WiFi, cellular or Ethernet connectivity.

Device Template

Device configurations are stored in something we call Device Template.

Each device starts from a template, which makes it easy to work with multiple devices that perform similar functions.

For example, you can create a Temperature Sensor Template and reuse it for all similar sensors in your house.
https://docs.blynk.io/en/concepts/device-template

Each Template consists of:
Datastreams - channels to transfer data from/to device
Mobile app UI
Web Dashboard UI
Notifications

When you update a template, the changes will be applied to all devices created from this template. How cool is that!
